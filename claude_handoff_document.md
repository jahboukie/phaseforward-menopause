## **🔧 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE STRATEGY**

### **CRITICAL DESIGN PRINCIPLE**
**DO NOT merge codebases or create dependency conflicts.** Each app must remain independent while being orchestrated through a central intelligence layer.

### **Repository Structure**
```
Health Ecosystem/
├── meno-monorepo/ (Keep as monorepo)
│   ├── menotracker/
│   ├── menopartner/
│   └── meno-community/
├── myconfidant/ (Separate repo)
├── dralexai/ (Separate repo)
├── soberpal/ (Separate repo)
├── inner-architect/ (Separate repo)
└── ecosystem-intelligence/ (NEW - Central orchestration)
    ├── api-gateway/
    ├── analytics-engine/
    ├── provider-dashboard/
    ├── sso-service/
    └── ai-orchestration/
```

### **Integration Architecture**
```
Central Intelligence Hub
├── SSO Authentication Service
│   └── Shared login → individual app tokens
├── Cross-App Analytics API
│   ├── Data ingestion from each app
│   ├── Correlation analysis engine
│   └── Provider dashboard API
├── AI Persona Coordination
│   ├── Context sharing between personas (NOT merging)
│   ├── Cross-app recommendation engine
│   └── Unified conversation history
└── Provider Intelligence Layer
    ├── Cross-app user insights
    ├── Relationship correlation data
    └── Clinical decision support
```

## **🎭 AI PERSONA STRATEGY**

### **PRESERVE INDIVIDUAL AI PERSONALITIES**
**Critical**: Each app has specialized AI personas master-prompted for specific users. These should NOT be merged but orchestrated:

- **MyConfidant ALEX**: Clinical, professional, ED-focused
- **DrAlexAI ALEX**: Bro-to-bro, experienced husband, relatable
- **MenoTracker AI**: Empathetic, women-focused, medical
- **MenoPartner AI**: Partner-supportive, educational
- **SoberPal AI**: Recovery-focused, motivational
- **Inner Architect AI**: Growth-oriented, philosophical

### **AI Orchestration Goals**
- **Context sharing** (not personality merging)
- **Cross-app recommendations** (MyConfidant suggests DrAlexAI when appropriate)
- **Unified insights** for providers (correlation data)
- **Preserved specialization** (each AI remains effective for its users)

## **🚀 IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION TASK**

### **Current Priority: Central API Gateway Infrastructure**
**Repository**: https://github.com/jahboukie/ecosystem-intelligence.git

### **Phase 1: API Gateway Setup**
Build the central orchestration system in the ecosystem-intelligence repository:

1. **API Gateway Service**
   - Routes requests between apps
   - Handles authentication/authorization
   - Manages rate limiting and security

2. **SSO Authentication Service**
   - Unified login system
   - Token management for individual apps
   - User session coordination

3. **Analytics Engine Foundation**
   - Data ingestion APIs for each app
   - Correlation analysis infrastructure
   - Provider dashboard backend

4. **Basic AI Orchestration**
   - Context sharing service
   - Recommendation engine foundation
   - Cross-app communication protocols

### **Technical Stack Recommendations**
- **API Gateway**: Node.js/Express or Python/FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for analytics, Redis for sessions
- **Authentication**: Supabase (consistent with existing apps)
- **Message Queue**: Redis/Bull for async processing
- **Monitoring**: Built-in logging and health checks
